                <h2>Ryan Brook</h2>
                <p>Ryan spends his time working with teams and organisations to change
                    their mindset from 'delivery at whatever cost' to 'value at whatever cost'. He uses
                    creativity and a positive attitude to affect change. Improving organisational 'culture' is
                    the backbone of Ryan's practice. Without it, he believes teams are not able to reap the
                    benefits of an empirical framework. He resides in Gloucester, UK, with his young family and
                    loves walking his dog.</p>
