    <p>Scrum Lake has been created by John Albrecht and Ryan Brook as a way to dive deeper into Scrum using the
        power
        of metaphor. They are both experienced Scrum Masters who love working with teams and helping them create a
        culture of continued improvement. Despite calling themselves Scrum Masters in their day to day jobs, here
        they call themselves Dive Masters -
        they help our workshop participants navigate through the Lake by facilitating deep discussions. Even
        though they are the facilitators, they are equally active participants in the journey. Their favourite part
        of
        Scrum Lake is meeting with other experienced practitioners and sharing ideas.

    <p>If you'd like to find out about our
        Dive Masters, you can take a look at their brief introductions below. However, they'd much prefer you to
        send
        them an email or message on their social media to create a valuable connection.

            <p>Ryan spends his time working with teams and organisations to change
                their mindset from 'delivery at whatever cost' to 'value at whatever cost'. Whilst he refers to himself
                as a Scrum Master, he isn't wedded to one particular framework. He uses
                creativity and a positive attitude to affect change and encourages people to find what
                works for them. Improving organisational culture is
                the backbone of Ryan's practice. Without it, he believes teams are not able to reap the
                benefits of an empirical framework.</p>
