        Scrum Lake has been created by John Albrecht and Ryan Brook as a way to dive deeper into Scrum using the power
        of metaphor. Find out about our divemasters below, drop us a question, ask us about private workshops or just
        connect with us.

            <h2>Ryan Brook</h2>
            <p>Ryan spends his time working with teams and organisations to change
                their mindset from 'delivery at whatever cost' to 'value at whatever cost'. He uses
                creativity and a positive attitude to affect change. Improving organisational 'culture' is
                the backbone of Ryan's practice. Without it, he believes teams are not able to reap the
                benefits of an empirical framework. He resides in Gloucester, UK with his young family and
                loves walking his dog.</p>
