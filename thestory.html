    <h3>Scrum Lake is simple, but difficult to navigate.</h3>

    <p>
        Our lake is a metaphor for Scrum. It's a more human way to explore how Scrum works in complex environments,
        making it easier to engage with its theorical basis. At its surface, it's turbulent, choppy, and unclear. At its
        depths, it's dark, uncharted and mysterious. As you and your team gain a deeper understanding of how to apply
        Scrum
        within your domain, you move deeper into Scrum Lake, hoping to make the unknown, transparent. We hope that the
        deeper you explore, the more value you find.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scrum Lake workshops are rich with analogies and metaphors to help explain tough Scrum concepts at a human
        level. Our lake contains treasure chests, sharks,
        submarines and many more things hidden within its waters. By creating common references, we hope it solidifies
        the
        value of the individual components of Scrum.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout our experience of working with teams, we've found that people learn through story telling and sharing
        common experiences. By creating a bounded environment, Scrum Lake enables participants to co-create their own
        discovery and learn new techniques without being overwhelmed by theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of our workshops are facilitated by experienced Scrum practitioners.
