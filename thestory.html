    <h3>Scrum Lake is simple, but difficult to navigate. It has been developed to
        provide a fun structure in which to discuss Scrum. You can find the story about how it was developed below.</h3>

    <p>
        It all started in August 2020 when Ryan and John got together to discuss tips and techniques for passing advaned
        Scrum assessments. They spoke about the content that they felt was needed, but more importantly, spoke about how
        this
        content is learned and embedded in the human psyche. As an ex-teacher, Ryan spoke about sticky-learning, the
        process of
        providing all knowledge with a 'hook' to make its re-call more fluid. To achieve this there are many options,
        but a common one is through story-telling. Our brains love to be treated like children, and it is due to this
        that we crave fun and imagination in our continued learning - metaphors and analogies are one way to achieve
        this. By working through personal metaphors for Scrum, they co-created their own learning path.
    </p>
    <p>
        In early September 2020, they decided to define a Product Vision. Until this point, Scrum Lake had been for
        personal use, but after seeing the value received by others felt it was a hypothesis to test on the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, they mapped out their metaphors' boundaries and created an interactive canvas from which to share
        them. This was the birth of Scrum Lake. Without attempting to, the structure formed a familiar 3, 5, 3 pattern,
        offering different but interwoven routes to explore Scrum Lake. The feedback it has received on this approach
        has been phenomenally positive.
    </p>
    <p>
        By continually running free workshops and incrementally developing our product, Scrum Lake has grown organically
        through input from its stakeholders. Ryan and John believe it has matured and shown value due to offering
        practitioners the chance
        to raise questions personal to them and explore them with fellow Scrum Masters.

        The lake is a metaphor for Scrum. It's a more human way to explore how Scrum works in complex environments,
        making it easier to engage with its theorical basis. At its surface, it's turbulent, choppy, and unclear. At its
        depths, it's dark, uncharted and mysterious. As you and your team gain a deeper understanding of how to apply
        Scrum within your domain, the idea is that you move deeper into Scrum Lake, hoping to make the unknown,
        transparent. The purpose is that
        the deeper you explore, the more value you find.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scrum Lake workshops are rich with analogies and metaphors to help explain tough Scrum concepts at a human
        level. The lake contains treasure chests, sharks,
        submarines and many more things hidden within its waters. If you'd like to take a look at the metaphors we use,

        of the individual components of Scrum.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout their experience of working with teams, John and Ryan have found that people learn through story
        telling and sharing
        common experiences. By creating a bounded environment, Scrum Lake enables participants to co-create their own
        discovery and learn new techniques without being overwhelmed by theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of the workshops are facilitated by experienced Scrum practitioners.
