        Scrum Lake started in August 2020 when Ryan and John got together to discuss tips and techniques for passing
        advanced Scrum assessments. They spoke about the content that they felt was needed, but more importantly, spoke
        about how this content is learned, embedded and embodied. Ryan's experience as an ex-teacher, his understanding
        of sticky-learning, the process of providing all knowledge with a 'hook' to make its re-call more fluid. John
        talked about his experiences of clean language, the power of metaphor and stories. There are many options to
        achieve effective recall, but a common one is through story-telling. Our brains love to play, we crave fun and
        imagination in our continued learning - metaphors and analogies are one way to achieve this. Over several weeks,
        John and Ryan worked together exploring personal metaphors for Scrum and learning, co-creating a unique way to
        explore scrum more deeply.

    <p>
        In early September 2020, after seeing the value received by others we felt it we needed to test a hypothesis
        that these metaphors and stories had value beyond our own learning and we decided we needed to test this out the
        market. We mapped out metaphors' boundaries and created an interactive canvas from which to share them. This was
        the birth of Scrum Lake. Unconsciously the structure and shape of the lake seemed to fall into place, it formed
        a familiar 3, 5, 3 patterns, offering interwoven routes, connections and paths to tell stories about Scrum. The
        feedback we have received on this approach has been phenomenally positive. By continually running workshops and
        incrementally developing our product, Scrum Lake has grown organically through input from its stakeholders. We
        believe it has matured and shown value due to offering practitioners the chance to raise questions personal to
        them and explore them with fellow Scrum Masters.

        Over time, they mapped out their metaphors' boundaries and created an interactive canvas from which to share
        them. This was the birth of Scrum Lake. Without attempting to, the structure formed a familiar 3, 5, 3 pattern,
        offering different but interwoven routes to explore Scrum Lake. The feedback it has received on this approach
        has been phenomenally positive.

        By continually running free workshops and incrementally developing our product, Scrum Lake has grown organically
        through input from its stakeholders. Ryan and John believe it has matured and shown value due to offering
        practitioners the chance
        to raise questions personal to them and explore them with fellow Scrum Masters.

        The lake is a metaphor for Scrum. It's a more human way to explore how Scrum works in complex environments,
        making it easier to engage with its theorical basis. At its surface, it's turbulent, choppy, and unclear. At its
        depths, it's dark, uncharted and mysterious. As you and your team gain a deeper understanding of how to apply
        Scrum within your domain, the idea is that you move deeper into Scrum Lake, hoping to make the unknown,
        transparent. The purpose is that
        the deeper you explore, the more value you find.
    </p>

        Scrum Lake workshops are rich with analogies and metaphors to help explain tough Scrum concepts at a human
        level. The lake contains treasure chests, sharks,
        submarines and many more things hidden within its waters. If you'd like to take a look at the metaphors we use,
        you can <a href='/metaphors'>click here.</a> By creating common references, we hope it solidifies the value
        of the individual components of Scrum.

    <p>
        Throughout their experience of working with teams, John and Ryan have found that people learn through story
        telling and sharing
        common experiences. By creating a bounded environment, Scrum Lake enables participants to co-create their own
        discovery and learn new techniques without being overwhelmed by theory.

        All of the workshops are facilitated by experienced Scrum practitioners.
