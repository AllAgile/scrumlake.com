    <h2>Scrum Lake is simple, but difficult to navigate</h2>

<p>
    Our Lake is a metaphor for Scrum, and a more human way to explore how our complex environments, explore Scrum and
    what it means more deeply with us using metaphors. At its surface, it's turbulent, choppy, and unclear. At it's
    depths, it's dark, uncharted and mysterious. As you and your team gain a deeper understanding of how to apply Scrum
    within your domain, you move deeper into Scrum Lake, hoping to make the unknown, transparent. We hope that the
    deeper you explore, the more value you may find.
</p>
    
<p>
    Scrum Lake workshops are rich with analogies and metaphors to help explain tough Scrum concepts at a human level. Our lake contains treasure chests, mirrors,
    submarines and many more hidden within its waters. By creating common references, we hope it solidifies the value of the individual components of Scrum.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout our experience of working with teams, we've found that people learn through story telling and sharing
    common experiences. By creating a bounded environment, Scrum Lake enables participants to co-create their own
    discovery and learn new techniques without being overwhelmed by theory.
</p>

<p>
    All of our workshops are facilitated by experiences Scrum practitioners. Come <a href="workshops">join us</a> on our next adventure to Scrum Lake and see what you will discover next.
