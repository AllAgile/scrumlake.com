title: Our metaphors and similes

<!--I would like to have relevant images alongside this glossary of sorts, but I've not put them in yet as I think we'd need a new template?-->

    In our workshops, we use a range of similes and metaphors to aid discussions. Whilst these are 'our' metaphors, we
    encourage you to come up with your own to support your understanding.
    <br />
    <h2>Scrum Lake</h2>
    <br />Scrum - Scrum is like a lake. It is deep and filled with unknowns due to its complexity. It has a turbulent
    surface where things aren't transparent, but the deeper you go, the more evidence you can gather to adapt the
    exploration. It is a lake based on empiricism.
    <br />Five Values - The values are the bedrock of the lake. They support the boundaries. If the bedrock cracks, the
    water can leak away, taking focus away from exploration and onto fixing the boundaries.
    <br />Three Pillars - The pillars support the whole lake. Without all three, the ability to explore and learn is
    impeded because the lake isn't supported. Any value produced from the lake is questionable.

    <br />
    <h2>The Events</h2>
    <br />Sprint - The Sprint is a voyage. It is timebound by the amount of supplies you take aboard your ship. All
    events and activities take place on the ship. It is a container for all things.
    <br />Sprint Planning - The Sprint Planning occurs whilst your ship is in port. You are at a 'known' location. You
    have gathered evidence from your previous voyages and use it to make a plan of where to explore next. You've
    gathered your supplies and you raise the sails to set off.
    <br />Daily Scrum - The Daily Scrum is the helm of the ship. Based on your recent progress, you need to adapt your
    course to ensure you remain on track to find your treasure. Sometimes you may not need to change your course, but you
    ensure you at least inspect the progress you've made.
    <br />Sprint Review - The Sprint Review occurs when you have found your treasure. You have travelled back to port
    and lowered your sails. You show your treasure to your stakeholders (the King/villagers), inspect it, and decide where
    you should explore next.
    <br />Sprint Retrospective - The Sprint Retrospective is where you have dropped your anchor and the explorers are
    discussing their voyage. They discuss how things went and they do this to make their issues transparent so that they can
    make improvements for next time.

    <br />
    <h2>The Scrum Team</h2>
    <br />People - The Scrum Team consists of explorers who are on the voyage. There are different accountabilities for
    each, but they are all equal in supporting the voyage. They explore together.
    <br />Impediments - The impediments are sharks in the lake. If they aren't avoided or removed from the lake, they
    will cause problems for the voyage. They make it so that you are less likely to obtain your treasure.
    <br />Technical Debt - Technical debt is like an octopus. It wraps its tentacles around the process, progress and
    outcomes and unless regularly attended to, can become ingrained and hard to remove.

    <br />
    <h2>The Artefacts and Commitments</h2>
    <br />Product Backlog - You have built up a scroll of everything you want to achieve on your voyages. You may not
    need to do all of them, but it's a possible list that your explorers think they will need to do to achieve their goal.
    <br />Product Goal - Your scroll has a title. It is a long term objective that they want to achieve. The title at
    the top of our scroll says: 'To own all the treasure in the lake so that we are the richest
    explorers of all time.' All explorers commit to this goal.
    <br />Sprint Backlog - You know where you want to explore for your treasure, but you need a map! The treasure map
    describes the general area of where to explore and makes a best effort to plot your voyage, but everyone agrees
    that it can be changed as you progress.
    <br />Sprint Goal - Every treasure map need an 'X' marks the spot. It is a fixed position, but how you get there is
    not fully known until you have made your voyage. Everyone agrees that it's achievable and valuable to get there.
    <br />Increment - The treasure chest! It contains lots of individual pieces of treasure but together, they hold much
    more value.
    <br />Definition of Done - You've found the treasure, but how do you guarantee it hasn't been tampered with? You use
    a padlock! When you deliver the treasure to the King/villagers, you can prove its quality by explaining what the
    padlock means and that they can trust the quality of it.
