            <p class="lead">For people interested in Scrum, Scrum Lake is a place to share stories,
                discuss techniques and take a deeper dive into Scrum theory, practice and reality. We facilitate Scrum
                Masters and coaches
                from around the world to deepen their understanding of the framework and improve their explanations of
                key concepts.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                We are proud that Scrum Lake workshops are consistently positively received. We believe this is due to a
                unique exploratory approach that encourages new ways of thinking.

            <p class="lead">Scrum Lake workshops are a safe and structured environment for Scrum enthusiasts to be able
                to
                discuss stories and work together to learn effective techniques to deliver positive change. They provide
                you with
                the opportunity to co-create your own exploration of deeper Scrum, facilitated by two experienced
                Scrum Masters. No matter what your 'level' of Scrum knowledge currently is, you are very welcome to join
                us and dive
                into our Lake to share, collaborate and grow.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                You will find our workshops to be a very interactive experience. The regular breakouts and story
                sharing, all
                bounded by supportive metaphors, help ensure that varieties of thought and opinion are surfaced and
                explored together.
