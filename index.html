            <p class="lead">We want to create a safe, structured environment for Scrum enthusiasts to be able to share
                stories, collaborate and learn effective techniques to effect positive change. Scrum Lake will be a
                place to co-create your own exploration of Scrum, facilitated by experienced Scrum Masters. No matter
                what your 'level' of Scrum knowledge is, you are welcome.</p>

                Workshops are run frequently, and every single one is different! That is the beauty of Scrum
                Lake. Your fellow collaborators will explore together. Do you want to dive deep into theory? Or stay
                shallow and share stories? Whatever you want, it's up to you.</p>
