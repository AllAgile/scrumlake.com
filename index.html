            <p class="lead">For folks interested in Scrum, Scrum Lake is a place to share stories,
                discuss techniques and take a deeper dive into the Scrum.  Work with Scrum Masters and Coaches 
                from around the world and uncover a much deeper understanding through metaphor

                Scrum Lake workshops have received many plaudits, due to the very different approach and they tend to sell out quickly.
